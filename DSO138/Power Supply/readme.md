>It's a popular question with newbies but no, resistor dividers shouldn't be used to power things as the voltage will fluctuate with the current drawn.

>Whatever you do, you need something that can tolerate 18v or more on the input for automotive use, ideally 24v+ (not hard to find), 12.6v is only a full car battery - alternators put out 14v or more these days and when things like fans or AC kick in & out you can get large spikes well above 36v which will fry unprotected devices.
